# Changelog

All notable changes to ProxMorph will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.7.3] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- **All themes** — Task Viewer window no longer loses its scrollbar. The blanket `.x-window .x-panel-body { overflow: visible !important }` rule was overriding ExtJS's own inline `overflow: auto` on scrollable panel bodies (`.x-scroller`). Fixed by scoping the rule to `:not(.x-scroller)`. Issue [#49](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/issues/49)
- **All themes** — CT and VM creation dialog tabs are no longer pushed off-screen. `position: relative !important` on `.x-tab` was overriding ExtJS box layout's absolute positioning, causing each tab's offset to double-count (natural flow position + intended left = tabs spreading ~1.5× wider than the container). Removed the offending declaration. Issue [#50](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/issues/50)
- **Catppuccin Latte** — Text on colored elements (progress bar fill, active buttons, badges) is now visible. `--ctp-on-accent` was set to `var(--ctp-base)` (`#eff1f5`, near-white), which is invisible on the light Latte background. Changed to `#ffffff` for proper contrast against vivid Latte accent fills (mauve, red, yellow). Issue [#51](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/issues/51)

## [2.7.2] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- **Sensors** — Added pre-patch Perl syntax check on Nodes.pm before applying the sensor patch. If Nodes.pm is already broken (e.g. from the v2.7.0 APT-hook heredoc bug), the user now gets an actionable error: *"Run 'apt install --reinstall pve-manager' to restore it, then re-run ProxMorph install."* instead of a misleading post-patch rollback message. Issue [#47](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/issues/47)
- **Sensors** — Rollback on post-patch syntax failure now restores from `Nodes.pm.original` backup when available, falling back to sed marker removal only if no backup exists.

## [2.7.1] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- **APT Hook** — Fixed broken heredoc escaping in `post-update.sh` that caused the Nodes.pm sensor patch to be injected as a single malformed line, breaking Perl syntax and preventing `pveproxy` from starting after a PVE update. Issue [#45](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/issues/45)
  - Added Perl syntax check (`perl -c`) after patching with automatic rollback if validation fails

## [2.7.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Sensor Selector** — Interactive per-sensor filtering for hardware monitoring. Issue [#44](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/issues/44)
  - `enumerate_sensors()` discovers all available sensors (CPU, NVMe, HDD, Fan) via `sensors -j`
  - `configure_sensor_filter()` interactive multi-select menu to choose which sensors to display
  - Filter stored in `/opt/proxmorph/.sensors-filter` (chip:label format), synced to cluster nodes
  - `manage-sensors` menu gains option 4) Configure sensor selection
  - `sensors configure` CLI subcommand for non-interactive reconfiguration
  - Backwards-compatible: missing/empty filter file shows all sensors
- **proxmorph-sensors.js** (v1.2.0) — Client-side sensor filtering
  - Reads `sensorsFilter` from API on each render (no first-load flash)
  - CPU cores shown individually when filter selects specific cores without Package sensor
  - APT hook updated to persist filter across PVE updates

## [2.6.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Proxmox Datacenter Manager (PDM) Support** — Full theme support for PDM 1.x:
  - New `install.sh` product detection: auto-detects PDM alongside PVE and PBS
  - 22 PDM-specific CSS override themes injected as `<link>` tags into `index.hbs`, activated via JavaScript based on `localStorage` selection
  - `proxmorph-pdm-base.css` — always-on component styling (rounded corners, shadows, button/panel/grid refinements)
  - `pdm-theme-selector.js` — MutationObserver-based patch that injects ProxMorph themes into PDM's native Theme dialog dropdown alongside built-in Desktop/Crisp options
  - PDM themes use CSS custom property overrides to remap `--pwt-color-*` tokens from the WASM-loaded base theme
  - Inline `<script>` in `index.hbs` activates saved theme before WASM loads (prevents flash of default theme)
  - APT hook updated with PDM-specific repatch logic (CSS re-injection + JS patch re-copy)
  - Clean uninstall: removes theme directory, JS patches, and injected `index.hbs` block; restores backup

### Changed
- **Installer** (`install.sh`):
  - Now supports PVE 8.x/9.x, PBS 3.x/4.x, **and PDM 1.x**
  - `manage-sensors` command now shows interactive menu instead of requiring subcommand
  - `verify` command (option 7) added to diagnose installation issues
  - `pveproxy` restart changed from background to synchronous for reliability
  - Prominent cache warning displayed after install/uninstall

### Fixed
- **Catppuccin Latte light theme icon/logo inversions** — Theme was generated from dark Catppuccin Mocha and retained dark-mode `filter: invert()` rules on loading indicators, folder icons, image-based icons (`.fa-ceph`, `.fa-sdn`, `.pve-itype-icon-qemu`, etc.), hardware icons, counter-invert cells, and the Proxmox logo. All are now `filter: none` as required by a light theme.
- **Sensors: Perl taint mode error on node status API** — Issue [#38](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/issues/38):
  - The `Nodes.pm` patch now sets `local $ENV{PATH} = '/usr/bin:/bin';` before all backtick (`sensors -j`, `upsc`) calls, satisfying Perl's `-T` taint mode requirement that `$ENV{PATH}` be untainted before external command execution
  - The UPS device name (`$ups_name`), obtained from tainted backtick output, is now validated and untainted via regex (`/^([\w@.-]+)$/`) before being passed to the `upsc` command — prevents an additional taint violation in the UPS data collection path
  - Affected users: anyone running ProxMorph sensors on a Proxmox host where `Nodes.pm` still has the old patch; fix requires re-running `install.sh` (or `install.sh manage-sensors disable && install.sh manage-sensors enable`) to re-apply the corrected patch
- **Sensors: sed regex escaping for UPS untaint** — Issue [#38](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/issues/38):
  - GNU sed's `i\` command drops backslash before unknown escapes (`\w` → `w`)
  - `patch_nodes_pm()` bash double-quoted sed now uses 4 backslashes (`\\\\w`)
  - APT hook post-update heredoc (3-level escaping chain) now uses 8 backslashes for correct `\w` output
- **Theme visibility after install** — Issue [#40](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/issues/40):
  - Added `verify` command (option 7) to diagnose installation issues (checks theme files, theme_map entries, JS patches, index template)
  - Changed `pveproxy` restart from background (`&`) to synchronous to ensure theme_map changes take effect before user checks browser
  - Added prominent cache warning after install/uninstall reminding users to hard-refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
  - Fixed `sed` delimiter in `patch_theme_map` to use `|` instead of `/` for consistency with uninstall path handling
## [2.5.1] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **Cluster-aware sensor deployment** — Installer now detects PVE cluster nodes and deploys the sensor API patch to all remote nodes automatically
  - Uses `pvecm nodes` to discover cluster members, scp to copy patched `Nodes.pm`, and restarts `pveproxy` on each node
  - Version check ensures local and remote PVE versions match before deploying
  - `sensors disable` cleanly removes the patch from all cluster nodes
  - Prompts before deploying to remote nodes; can be skipped to run `install.sh` on each node individually

### Fixed
- **System Log scroll to bottom** — Issue [#36](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/issues/36):
  - Removed `scroll-behavior: smooth !important` from `.x-panel-body-default` in UniFi and UniFi Light themes
  - This CSS rule broke ExtJS's synchronous scroll position tracking — the JournalView `scrollTo()` call would animate instead of applying instantly, causing the position read-back to return 0 and preventing auto-scroll to the newest log entries
  - The `html { scroll-behavior: smooth }` rule is preserved for page-level smooth scrolling
- **Sensor row hidden when not enabled** — Sensor row in node Status panel now hides completely when the API patch is not applied, instead of showing "N/A"
- **Missing VMs/LXCs in backup job dialog** — Issue [#37](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/issues/37):
  - The `.x-form-trigger-wrap-default` height rule (`height: 28px !important`) was matching the VMSelector grid body, collapsing it to a single visible row
  - Added `:not(.x-grid-body)` exclusion to the selector in UniFi and UniFi Light themes

## [2.5.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **Native Hardware Sensor Monitoring** — Issue [#22](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/issues/22):
  - New `proxmorph-sensors.js` patch injects CPU/Storage thermal readings, fan speeds, and UPS status directly into the node Summary dashboard
  - Auto-detects `lm-sensors` hardware: coretemp (Intel), k10temp (AMD), NVMe, SATA/drivetemp, and fan sensors
  - Optional UPS monitoring via `upsc` (Network UPS Tools) — shows status, charge, load, and runtime
  - Color-coded temperature warnings (yellow at 80°C, red at 95°C) using theme CSS variables (`--pm-warning`, `--pm-error`)
  - Installer auto-detects available sensors and prompts to enable during `install.sh` — patches `Nodes.pm` API to expose `sensors -j` output
  - Fully optional: can be enabled/disabled independently via `install.sh manage-sensors`
  - Graceful degradation: shows "N/A" when lm-sensors is not installed or no sensors detected
- **UniFi Light Theme** — contributed by [@OiCkilL](https://github.com/OiCkilL) ([PR #34](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/pull/34)):
  - Light variant of the UniFi theme with Tier 3 comprehensive coverage
  - Includes custom chart patching (`unifi-light-charts.js`) for consistent light-mode chart colors

### Fixed
- **Blue Slate Theme** — Issue [#25](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/issues/25):
  - **Complete v2.0.0 overhaul** — ported all Tier 2 fixes from the Dracula reference theme (1068 → 1568 lines)
  - Fixed close "X" button white background — added `background-color: transparent` on `.x-panel-header-default .x-tool-tool-el` and `.x-window-header-default .x-tool-img`
  - Ported FontAwesome tool icon replacements (close, gear, refresh, collapse/expand, maximize/restore, zoom) with hover, disabled, and inline FA states
  - Added global border-radius architecture (reset-everything/re-apply pattern) replacing simple `border-radius: 6px`
  - Fixed hardware icon text invisible — changed `invert(90%)` → `invert(100%)` with double-cancellation on `.x-grid-cell-inner` children + transparent borders on `<td>` cells
  - Added 28px button height consistency with `:not()` exclusions, `.x-btn-wrap` flex centering, icon-only button fix, `.fa-desktop` translateY (Issue #17 port)
  - Added custom checkbox/radio styling with SVG checkmark and animated radio dot
  - Added dropdown/boundlist fixes: `border: none`, `outline: none`, `cursor: pointer` (Issue #24 port)
  - Added menu item flexbox reordering for icon-left layout (Issue #24 port)
  - Added column panel `max-width: none` fix (Issue #23 port)
  - Added segmented button radius consistency
  - Added console/terminal, legend/chart, progress bar, date picker, tag edit, APT repo, markdown `.pmx-md`, `.pmx-hint`, and usage bar styling
  - Added smooth transitions on grid rows, tree items, menus, boundlists, tabs, splitters, tooltips, progress bars
  - Added Firefox scrollbar support (`scrollbar-width: thin`)
  - Added keyboard focus outline removal, `cursor: pointer` on interactive elements
  - Added `display: none !important` respect for hidden dialog buttons
  - Added login dialog border cleanup
- **20 Themes** — Issue [#24](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/issues/24):
  - Fixed dropdown context menu icons aligned to the right instead of left — root cause: CSS targeted non-existent `.x-menu-item-link-default` class; changed selector to `.x-menu-item-default > .x-menu-item-link` across all affected themes
  - Fixed ugly dotted focus borders on boundlist dropdown items (e.g. Server View selector) — added `border: none !important` and `outline: none !important` to `.x-boundlist-item` rules
  - Standardized boundlist item padding (`4px 8px`) and cursor (`pointer`) across all themes for consistent dropdown appearance
- **9 Theme Families** — Issue [#17](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/issues/17):
  - Fixed icons misaligned in larger top-bar buttons (Create VM, Create CT, root@pam) across all UniFi-based themes except UniFi itself
  - Ported 5 missing CSS blocks from the UniFi reference: `.x-btn-wrap` flex centering, `.x-btn-inner` flex centering, dropdown arrow alignment, icon-only button fix, and `.fa-desktop` translateY compensation
  - Affected base themes: Catppuccin Mocha, Dracula, Tokyo Night, Nord Dark/Light, Solarized Dark/Light, Gruvbox Dark/Light (plus all generated variants)
- **All Themes (22 files)** — Issue [#18](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/issues/18):
  - Fixed panel title text being clipped by removing `overflow: hidden !important` from `.x-panel` rules across all themes
  - Fixed Hardware tab text becoming invisible on SVG-icon rows (`pve-itype-icon-*`) due to `filter: invert()` — changed to `invert(100%)` with double-cancellation on `.x-grid-cell-inner` children for perfect text brightness matching (7 dark themes + variants)
  - Fixed bright border artifacts on inverted Hardware icon rows — added `border-color: transparent !important` on affected `<td>` cells (7 dark themes + variants)
  - Fixed SCSI Controller icon (`fa-database`) being incorrectly dimmed — removed `.fa-database::before` from the broad icon color override selector in all 13 base themes
  - Fixed panel title/header text clipped by border-radius — added `overflow: visible !important` on `.x-title-text`, `.x-title-text-default`, `.x-panel-header`, and `.x-panel-header-default` across all 11 non-UniFi base themes (root cause: global `.x-border-box *` border-radius interacting with ExtJS native `overflow: hidden`)
- **19 Themes** — Issue [#28](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/issues/28):
  - Fixed table hover/selection border-radius inconsistencies — removed `border-radius: var(--pm-radius-lg) !important` from `.x-grid-item-over` and `.x-grid-item-selected` rules across all derivative themes (Catppuccin ×5, Dracula ×6, Nord ×2, Solarized ×2, Gruvbox ×2, Tokyo Night, Blue Slate)
  - Removed dedicated `border-radius: 8px !important` grid rounding block from GitHub Dark
  - Root cause: UniFi's rounded hover/selection looked fine with its complex grid handling, but derivatives ported the radius without the supporting rules, causing visual artifacts (hover backgrounds bleeding into adjacent row borders)
  - Fixed hardware grid icon rendering across all 17 dark themes — replaced `filter: invert(100%)` + counter-invert approach with CSS `mask-image` SVG rendering for all `pve-itype-icon-*` (VM Hardware) and `pmx-itype-icon-*` (LXC Resources) grid cells; icons now render original SVG shapes in theme text color via `background-color: currentColor` with proper spacing matching FontAwesome icons (18px width, 10px right margin)
  - Fixed LXC Resources tab darkened text on Memory and Cores rows — PVE 9.x uses `pmx-itype-icon-*` classes (not `pve-itype-icon-*`) on LXC Resources grid cells; the Issue #18 fix only targeted `pve-` prefixed selectors
  - Icon types covered: cpu, memory, cdrom, pci, serial, die (VM Hardware via `/pve2/images/*.svg`) + processor, memory (LXC Resources via `../images/*.svg`)
  - Fixed grid container border-radius clipping first/last row hover backgrounds — removed `border-radius: 12px !important` from `.x-panel-default .x-grid` and `.x-container .x-grid-view` selectors (keeping only `.pve-info-grid`), and changed `.x-grid, .x-grid-view` re-apply rule from `var(--pm-radius-lg)` to `0` across all 22 themes; root cause: `overflow: hidden` on `.x-grid` combined with `border-radius` clipped hover/selection backgrounds at rounded corners of first and last grid rows
- **All Themes (21 files)** — Issue [#30](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/issues/30):
  - Fixed toolbar buttons (Shutdown, Console, More, etc.) vibrating/changing width when dropdown menus open — added `padding: 4px 8px !important` to `.x-btn-default-toolbar-small.x-btn.x-btn-menu-active` and `.x-btn-default-toolbar-small.x-btn.x-btn-pressed` rules across all themes; root cause: ExtJS default CSS increases padding from `4px 8px` to `4px 10px` on menu-active/pressed state, causing a 4px total width increase

## [2.4.1] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- **All Themes (19 files)** — Ported FontAwesome tool icon replacements from UniFi v5.86:
  - Replaced sprite-based ExtJS tool icons (close, gear, refresh, collapse/expand, maximize/restore, zoom) with crisp FontAwesome glyphs
  - Added hover, disabled, and inline FontAwesome states for consistent tool icon theming

### Fixed
- **All Themes (21 files)** — Fixed Documentation button height mismatch (Issue [#15](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/issues/15)):
  - Documentation/Help inline buttons (`proxmox-inline-button`) were 24px while Create VM/CT/root buttons were 28px — added explicit `height: 28px`, `display: flex`, `align-items: center`, and consistent padding to `.proxmox-inline-button` across all themes
- **All Themes (19 files)** — Issue [#23](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/issues/23):
  - Fixed summary panel data values (Status, CPU, Memory, etc.) being invisible on node/VM/storage summary pages — removed `max-width: calc(50% - 10px)` constraint on `.x-panel.x-column` that clipped ExtJS-calculated inner widths, restoring native stacked vertical layout
- **UniFi Theme** — Issue [#19](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/issues/19), Issue [#20](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/issues/20):
  - Fixed Maximum/Average segmented toggle buttons having incorrect rounded interior corners and hover border overlapping adjacent button
  - Fixed hover glow effect on Max/Avg toggle being cut off due to missing padding/overflow
- **Blue Slate Theme** — Issue [#26](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/issues/26):
  - Fixed inconsistent dotted borders between dropdown list elements
- **UniFi Theme** (v5.94) — Issue [#11](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/issues/11):
  - Fixed PBS summary panel clipping after "Boot Mode" row — reduced widget padding (5px→3px) and added PBS-specific body padding rule
  - Fixed CPU/RAM icons not loading on PBS — changed absolute paths (`/pve2/`, `/pwt/`) to relative paths (`../images/`) for PVE+PBS compatibility
  - Fixed grid status icons (`.good`/`.warning`/`.critical`) showing grey instead of green/yellow/red — added specificity-matched color overrides after the broad `.fa` color rule
  - Increased navigation tree icon-to-label gap (margin-left 20px→28px) for better readability

## [2.4.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- **7 New Theme Collections** — contributed by [@W0CHP](https://github.com/W0CHP) ([PR #12](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/pull/12)):
  - Gruvbox Dark — warm retro groove colors with yellow accent
  - Gruvbox Light — light variant of Gruvbox palette
  - Nord Dark — arctic, bluish-cold palette from Nord
  - Nord Light — light variant of Nord palette
  - Solarized Dark — dark variant of precision colors for machines
  - Solarized Light — light variant of Solarized palette
  - Tokyo Night — dark theme inspired by Tokyo's neon lights

### Changed
- **Installer** (`install.sh`) — contributed by [@W0CHP](https://github.com/W0CHP):
  - Now prioritizes local script directory over `/opt/proxmorph` cache for development workflows
  - Syncs themes and JS patches to `/opt/proxmorph/` cache when installing from local source
  - Improved theme discovery for dynamic registration

### Fixed
- **Light Themes** (Nord/Gruvbox/Solarized Light):
  - Removed dark mode icon inversions (`filter: invert(90%)`) that caused icons to appear washed out
  - Removed logo inversion (`filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg)`) for proper display on light backgrounds
  - Removed brightness filters designed for dark backgrounds
- **Variable Prefixes** (all new themes):
  - Replaced inherited `--drac-*` prefix with theme-specific prefixes (`--grv-*`, `--nord-*`, `--sol-*`, `--tn-*`)

## [2.3.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **Catppuccin Theme Collection** (5 themes):
  - Catppuccin Mocha — darkest flavor with mauve accent
  - Catppuccin Macchiato — mid-dark flavor with blue-tinted base
  - Catppuccin Frappé — lightest dark flavor with muted blue base
  - Catppuccin Latte — official light variant with purple accent
  - Catppuccin Mocha Teal — Mocha palette with teal accent
- **Dracula Theme Collection** (6 themes):
  - Dracula — classic dark with purple accent
  - Dracula Pink — pink accent variant
  - Dracula Cyan — cyan accent variant
  - Dracula Midnight — near-black backgrounds from Dracula UI spec
  - Dracula Green — forest-tinted backgrounds with green accent
  - Dracula Orange — warm-tinted backgrounds with orange accent
- **Variant Generator** (`generate-variants.ps1`) for creating theme variants from templates
- Screenshots for all 14 themes in README gallery

### Fixed
- **UniFi Theme** — Issue [#9](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/issues/9):
  - Fixed shrunken text boxes in Notes edit and other input fields (PR [#10](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/pull/10) by [@drafty46](https://github.com/drafty46))
- **Chart Layout** (all new themes + GitHub Dark):
  - Fixed RRD chart panels stacking in single column instead of 2-column grid
  - Root cause: `padding: 0 !important` on `.x-panel` overrode ExtJS inline `padding: 5px`, triggering a scrollbar-induced sub-pixel overflow feedback loop (2×790px panels > 1579.6px container)
  - Solution: Added `.x-panel.x-column` rule with `max-width: calc(50% - 10px)`, `margin: 5px`, and `padding: 5px` to prevent overflow
  - Removed `:not(.x-draw-container)` from column border selector — chart panels (proxmoxRRDChart) have the `.x-draw-container` class and were incorrectly excluded from card styling

## [2.2.5] - 2026-01-26

### Fixed
- **UniFi Theme (v5.93)** — Issue [#1](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/issues/1):
  - Fixed task viewer/log viewer issues: content not visible on open, scrollbar not clickable, no auto-scroll to bottom
  - Root cause: `overflow: visible !important` rule on `.x-window .x-panel-body` completely broke native ExtJS scroll handling
  - Solution: **Removed the problematic overflow rule entirely** - the rule was added for "modal clipping" but caused more issues than it solved
  - Increased scrollbar width from 8px to 12px for better clickability (was hard to click near window edge)
- **UniFi Theme (v5.90)**:
  - Fixed migrate icon missing in resource tree when VM/CT is being migrated
  - Root cause: `.running::after` rule (green status dot) has `content: "\f111" !important` which overrides `.lock-migrate::after` content when both classes are present
  - Solution: Added more specific `.running.lock-migrate::after` selector that shows the migrate icon (paper-plane) with amber color
  - Also added rules for `.lock-backup` and `.lock-suspending` states
- **UniFi Theme (v5.89)** — Issue [#3](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/issues/3):
  - Fixed delete dialog warning text "Referenced disks will always be destroyed." being cut off
  - Root cause: ExtJS box layout set narrow container width (236px) causing text wrap, then 0px height due to absolute positioning
  - Solution: Added `white-space: nowrap` to `.pmx-hint` to keep text on single line

## [2.2.4] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed
- **Installer** — Issue [#5](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/issues/5):
  - Fixed `sed` delimiter issue during uninstall that caused "extra characters after command" error (PR #6 by @jiriteach)
  - Root cause: Marker text `<!-- /ProxMorph JS Patches -->` contained `/` which conflicted with sed's default delimiter
  - Solution: Use `|` as alternate delimiter and properly escape special regex characters
- **UniFi Theme (v5.88)** — Issue [#4](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/issues/4):
  - Fixed "Finish Edit" checkmark button appearing on tags when not in edit mode
  - Root cause: `.x-btn-default-small { display: flex !important }` overrode Proxmox's inline `display: none`
  - Solution: Added rule to respect inline `display: none` styles for dynamically hidden buttons
  - Fixed dark text on tags in edit mode (e.g., teal `testesteste` tag had black text)
  - Tags now always use light text (#F9FAFA) when in edit mode, regardless of `proxmox-tag-dark` classification
  - Fixed "More" button position in IPs section not visible (was positioned off-screen)
  - Corrected transform value from -430px to -242px to align with current PVE 9.x layout

## [2.2.3] - 2026-01-20

### Fixed
- **Installer**:
  - Improved PVE version detection to report specific manager version (e.g., v9.1.4) instead of metapackage version (v9.1.0)
  - Suppressed misleading "Themes directory not found" error during one-liner (`curl | bash`) installations
  - Added robust guards for script path detection via `BASH_SOURCE`

## [2.2.2] - 2026-01-20

### Added
- **Proxmox Backup Server (PBS) Support** — Issue [#2](https://github.com/IT-BAER/proxmorph/issues/2):
  - The installer now officially supports PBS (v3.x/4.x)
  - Auto-detects product (PVE or PBS) and adjusts paths automatically
  - Native integration with PBS theme selector
  - Persistence across PBS updates via apt hook
  - JavaScript patches support for PBS template format (.hbs)

## [2.2.1] - 2026-01-20

### Fixed
- **Apt Hook**:
  - Fixed `[[: not found` syntax error in `post-update.sh` by enforcing POSIX compliance (ensures compatibility with `dash`/`sh`)
- **GitHub Dark Theme**:
  - **Tree/Toolbox Highlights**:
    - Ported authentic UniFi highlight mechanism (using pseudo-elements) to fix "double background" and text artifacts
  - **Structural Alignment**:
    - Ported UniFi border structures (radius, padding, layout) to Windows, Panels, and Fieldsets while preserving GitHub colors
  - **Resource Tree**:
    - Removed default blue focus borders
    - Aligned cell padding with UniFi standards
- **UniFi Theme (v5.85)**:
  - Fixed horizontal scrollbar in resource tree (1px overflow caused by CSS specificity conflict)
  - Added scrollbar corner styling to eliminate white square artifact at corner intersection
- **UniFi Theme (v5.87)**:
  - Fixed "More" button position in IPs section of Summary panel for variable IP count
  - Button now correctly positioned next to "IPs" label regardless of whether 1, 2, or more IPs are displayed
  - Root cause: ExtJS dynamically sets button's `top` based on container height
  - Solution: Anchor to `top: 0` then use consistent transform for fine positioning
  - Added overflow:visible to parent containers to prevent clipping

### Added
- **UniFi Theme (v5.86)**:
  - Replaced sprite-based ExtJS tool icons with crisp FontAwesome icons:
    - Zoom out (undo zoom), collapse/expand panel chevrons
    - Maximize/restore window icons
    - Gear (settings) and refresh icons
  - Distinct icons for collapse vs expand states (chevron direction indicates action)
  - Added styling for generic inline FontAwesome tool icons (e.g., "Reset form data" button)
  - Fixed disabled tool icon mask overlay (transparent background, non-blocking pointer events)
- **Chart Hover Dots**:
  - Added subtle white border (1px) to chart data point dots when hovered
  - Improves visibility of hover state against colored fills

## [2.2.0] - 2026-01-18

### Added
- **JavaScript Chart Patching**:
  - Implemented `unifi-charts.js` to dynamically patch Proxmox RRD charts
  - Adds true UniFi color palette validation (Green/Blue) to charts
  - Solves "Network Traffic" chart blending issues by layering areas correctly
- **Installation**:
  - `install.sh` now installs JavaScript patches to `/usr/share/pve-manager/js/proxmorph/`
  - persistence across PVE updates via APT hook (post-update re-patching)

## [2.1.1] - 2026-01-18
